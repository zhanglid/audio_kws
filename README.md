## 1. Description
> We might be on the verge of too many screens. It seems like everyday, new versions of common objects are “re-invented” with built-in wifi and bright touchscreens. A promising antidote to our screen addiction are voice interfaces.<br />

But, for independent makers and entrepreneurs, it’s hard to build a simple speech detector using free, open data and code. Many voice recognition datasets require preprocessing before a neural network model can be built on them. To help with this, TensorFlow recently released the Speech Commands Datasets. It includes 65,000 **one-second** long utterances of **30 short words**, by thousands of different people.<br />
<br/>
In this competition, you're challenged to use the Speech Commands Dataset to **build an algorithm that understands simple spoken commands**. By improving the **recognition accuracy of open-sourced voice interface tools**, we can improve product effectiveness and their accessibility.
